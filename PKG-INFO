Description: 
            This module provides a daemon that aggregates SGAS accounting records
            as collected by the SGAS LUTS into a set of aggregates. The aggregates
            are stored in database tables that (should) allow retrieval for several
            representations of the data wihtout need for being further processed 
            (like usage records summed up etc.).
            
Platform: Linux
