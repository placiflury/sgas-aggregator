This module provides a daemon that aggregates SGAS accounting records
as collected by the [SGAS LUTS](http://www.sgas.se) into a set of aggregates. The aggregates
are stored in database tables that (should) allow retrieval for several
representations of the data wihtout need for being further processed
(like usage records summed up etc.).
